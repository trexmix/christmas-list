# Elijah's Christmas List

Roughly in order of preference. When I give specifics I don't mean to be picky, just to help clear up what I would like. 

**Thinking Fast and Slow**- [Book](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555)

**Artificial Intelligence Powerlifting Programming** - [Available here](https://www.jtsstrength.com/juggernaut-ai-coaching/). This is a subscription based thing, so I would prefer 3+ months to get feedback. I would wait til after Christmas because I would need to set it up.

**New Wallet**- Anything goes. I like bifold and leather but have no other real necessities.

**Prosperity**- [Steam link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/734980/Prosperity/)

**Scientific Principles of Strength Training**- [Link](https://www.jtsstrength.com/product/scientific-principles-of-strength-training/) Really cool book with great information about programming workouts

**Sushi Go**- [Board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133473/sushi-go). I think all of the Trexler's+Granna would like it.

**Nice cooking knife**- Specifically one really good knife. I would want to keep it in my room so that my roommates can't use it so I would want one really good one (not a set). But I already have some knives so I would really only want a high quality one (I have some alright ones).

**NATO Straps for Watch**- Preferably something striped like [this](https://natostrapco.com/collections/all-watch-straps/products/the-gentleman-ii-nato-strap-w-polished-hardware). I also need pins for it and the correct size (Grady will be able to help with some of that).

**Cast Iron Pan**- Same idea as the cooking knife- would just like something high quality that I could use for a lot of things. 

**New shoes**- Not sure what style I want

**Flamme Rouge**- [Board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199478/flamme-rouge). This is another cool board game but I would only get it if you would play it with me.

**Watches**- I have a few on my Amazon wishlist, Mom has access to it.
